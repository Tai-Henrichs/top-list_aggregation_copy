    This method implements an exact algorithm for 
    finding the optimal solution to the Kemeny top-list problem
    using integer programming.
    -------------------------------------

    Params

    'data': Counter object 
            The keys  in this Counter are tuple top-lists and the 
            values are the mulitiplicities of each top-list. Both 
            the elements in the tuples and the values are ints

    'params': dict
              A python dictionary with that holds statics and info
              on the dataset stored on 'data'. Some of the keys are
              'n', 'N', 'k', and 'theta'. Refer to sim.py for full
              documentation.

    Returns 

    'AGORITHM_NAME': str
                     The identifier for the algorithm implemented in
                     this current file.

    'time': float
            Time if took for the main component of the algorithm to run

    'acccuracy': float
                 The generalized Kendall Tau Distance between the 
                 dataset top-lists and sigma
