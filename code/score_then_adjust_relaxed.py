    This method implements a variation of the 
    Score-Then-Adjust EPTAS. Note that this 
    variation is not guaranteed to be an 
    EPTAS, unlike Score-Then-Adjust. 
    Score-Then-Adjust has its call 
    to an Integer-Program replaced with 
    a linear programming relaxation.

    Params

    'data': Counter object 
            The keys  in this Counter are tuple top-lists and the 
            values are the mulitiplicities of each top-list. Both 
            the elements in the tuples and the values are ints

    'params': dict
              A python dictionary with that holds statics and info
              on the dataset stored on 'data'. Some of the keys are
              'n', 'N', 'k', and 'theta'. Refer to sim.py for full
              documentation.

                     The identifier for the algorithm implemented in

    'time': float
            Time if took for the main component of the algorithm to run

    'acccuracy': float
                 The generalized Kendall Tau Distance between the
